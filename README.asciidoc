*Setting up an Arquillian profile & Test Framework*

Arquillian supports testing in multiple containers. This is done by using a Maven profile for each container. This makes it possible to have multiple containers configured side-by-side too.
To add a new profile you use the arquillian setup command:

`arquillian-setup`

This command will prompt for which testframework to use, do you want to use standalone mode, if not then which container to use.

If you need to install an additional container profile, run command:

`arquillian-add-container`

In above command if selected container is supported by https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-container-chameleon[chameleon] then it is configured using chameleon, otherwise it will add required dependency to setup container.

For managed containers it might make sense to automatically download & install the container during the build to make installation on a build server more easy. This is only supported for AS7 at this moment.
You can also type --<TAB> to auto-complete with the desired options.

*Generating tests*

Writing Arquillian tests is trivial, and is documented well: https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Reference+Guide

Forge can help you get started however. 

`arquillian-create-test --targets demo.CoolBean --archiveType JAR`
	
Of course you can use the TAB key to navigate to the class that you want to test.


*Arquillian Cube*

*Setup:*

To add Arquillian Cube dependencies configuration options in arquillian.xml, run command:

`arquillian-cube-setup --type docker-compose --file-path docker-compose.yml`

Before running above command make sure that file provided with file-path is exists.

*Create Test:*

To create a test class, run command:

`arquillian-create-test --named MyDockerComposeTest --target-package org.arquillian.cube`.

*Add Cube Test & Enrichers:*

To enrich a given Arquillian test with respective annotations depending on selected type, run command:

`arquillian-cube-add-test --test-class org.cube.docker.MyDockerComposeTest`

Same way you can create a test for Kubernetes, Docker, Openshift.
